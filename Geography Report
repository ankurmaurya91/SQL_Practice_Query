Problem statement
A U.S graduate school has students from Asia, Europe and America. The students' location information are stored in table student as below.


| name   | continent |
|--------|-----------|
| Jack   | America   |
| Pascal | Europe    |
| Xi     | Asia      |
| Jane   | America   |


Pivot the continent column in this table so that each name is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding continent. The output headers should be America, Asia and Europe respectively. It is guaranteed that the student number from America is no less than either Asia or Europe.


For the sample input, the output is:


| America | Asia | Europe |
|---------|------|--------|
| Jack    | Xi   | Pascal |
| Jane    |      |        |

select  max(case when continent='America' then name end) as "America" ,
        max(case when continent='Asia' then name end ) as "Asia",
        max(case when continent='Europe' then name end) as "Europe"

         from (select name , continent, row_number() over(partition by continent
         order by name) as rn from student) as temp group by rn order by rn
